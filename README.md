# Tic-Tac-Toe
Interactive Tic Tac Toe game that utilizes the minimax algorithm on a 3x3 standard board. 

Instructions to Run:

To run the game, download the files, find the index.html file in your file explorer, and open that file with a browser of your choice. On the webpage, you will see a 3x3 board that has an X on it. The blue X's are the symbols that the AI uses, and your symbols (the user) are red O's. 

To place an O, you must hover your cursor above the desired spot and click. However, the move must be valid (an empty space) or else the click will be ignored (you must pick another spot). 

Like always, the goal of the game is to win. A win is done by connecting 3 of your symbols in a row (vertically, diagonally, or horizontally). A draw happens if neither player can get 3 of their symbols in a row after all of the spaces have been filled. 

Have fun playing!
